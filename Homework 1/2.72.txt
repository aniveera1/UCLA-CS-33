A) The conditional test always succeeds because in the if statement an unsigned
integer is being subtracted from a signed integer; therefore, C implicity casts
the signed integer to an unsigned integer and any operation involving two
unsigned integers will always return a value >= 0, which is why the conditional
test always succeeds.
B) The following code will work:
void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
     int spaceLeft = maxbytes - sizeof(val);
     if (spaceLeft >= 0)
     	memcpy(buf, (void *) &val, sizeof(val));
}
